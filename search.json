    "text": "Graphs help people understand data quickly - much faster than looking at huge tables full of numbers. You’ve probably made a graph in MicroSoft Excel by clicking buttons and changing settings. That’s fine for one or two graphs, but:\n\nWhat if you needed to make 10, 100, or even 1,000 graphs?\nDoing it all by hand would take ages and could lead to mistakes!\n\nUsing Python, we can:\n\nWrite instructions to make the graph for us\nRe-use the same code for lots of different data\nSave time and make fewer errors\nCreate really professional-looking graphs - like the ones used in the news, by scientists, or in apps and websites.\n\n\n\nWhy is Python a more powerful tool than Excel when we want to create lots of graphs?\n\nPython looks cooler\nPython graphs are interactive by default\nYou can re-use code and avoid doing everything by hand\nExcel can’t make graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData scientists use Python to help explain results to doctors, politicians, and business leaders\nThe code helps people make big decisions using data!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll make your own graphs using Python\nDon’t worry if you’ve never used Python before - that’s OK!\nWe’ll give you code to start with\nYou’ll just edit parts of it to see what happens\n\n\n⚠️ You might not understand everything in the code - and that’s totally normal! Even professional programmers don’t always understand it all straight away. Just have a go, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nSome animals live really long lives. The oldest human ever was a French woman named Jeanne Calment - she lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days! That’s pretty impressive… but some animals can live even longer.\nWhat’s their secret? Scientists are trying to find out - and if they do, it could help us understand how to live longer, healthier lives too. Below are some examples of long-lived animals:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this activity, you’ll use Python to make plots showing how long different animals can live. You’ll get to customise your graphs and compare short- and long-lived species.\nWhat you’ll learn\n\nSome animals live way longer than others - we’ll find out which!\nHow to use Python to explore real data\nHow to make custom plots showing animal lifespans\n\n\n\n\n\nPython does not know how to process and plot data on its own. Python packages contain additional commands that don’t come installed with Python, and allow us to carry out certain extra tasks.\nIn this activity we’ll use two important ones:\n\npandas - lets python read and edit data (much like you’d use Excel to process raw data)\nmatplotlib - helps us draw graphs and plots\n\nTo use them, copy and paste the code below into your first code chunk, then press the play button:\n\n\nCode\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the pandas package help Python do?\n\nDraw pictures of pandas\nRead and work with data\nMake animations\nSend emails\n\n\n\nAs part of this code, we rename the packages to something shorter. ‘Matplotlib.pyplot’ is quite a lot of letters to type every time! Each time we used it we’d have to type:\nmatplotlib.pyplot.plot\n\nInstead, we can rename the package as we load it to something simple and easy to remember. In this case ‘plt’. So the above line of code would become:\nplt.plot\n\nIn summary, this is how we load and rename a package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we rename packages like matplotlib.pyplot to something shorter like plt?\n\nIt saves time when writing code\nIt makes the code easier to write\nIt is required for the code to run\nIt makes the code easier to read\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we are going to load our animal ageing data. The data we’re going to be using can be found here. We are going to load it using the package mentioned earlier ‘pandas’. Remember, we have loaded ‘pandas’ and renamed it to ‘pd’.\n\nThe code to load the data is below.\n\n\nCode\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CBFLivUni/scholars_event/refs/heads/main/data/animal_ageing_data.csv\") \n\n\nWe use the read_csv function contained inside the ‘pandas’ package to load the data at the url. We then store it in a variable called ‘data’ using the equals sign.\nWe can view the data by typing the name of the variable in a code chunk:\n\n\nCode\ndata\n\n\n\nWhat does this code do?\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"some_data.csv\")\n\nDraw a graph\nLoad a function\nPrint some data to the screen\nLoad a dataset from a file\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of rows and columns in our data. In the code below we will extract just the oldest animals from the data, and then we will print out their names and lifespans.\n\n\nCode\n# Find the top 8 longest living animals\noldest_animals = data.sort_values(\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\", ascending=False).head(8)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe 8 longest-living animals in this dataset are:\")\nprint(oldest_animals[[\"Common name\", \"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"]])\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 8 longest-living animals in this dataset are:\n\n\n          Common name  Maximum longevity (yrs)\n0   Ocean quahog clam                    507.0\n1     Greenland shark                    392.0\n2       Bowhead whale                    211.0\n3   Rougheye rockfish                    205.0\n4      Red sea urchin                    200.0\n5  Galapagos tortoise                    177.0\n6       Lake sturgeon                    152.0\n7               Human                    122.5\n\n\nIn this code we take our data and sort it in order of longevity. We tell it NOT to do it in ascending order by saying ascending=False. We take the top 8 by including head(8). We then save it in a new variable called ‘oldest animals’.\nAfter that, we print the two colums we are interested in (“Common name” and “Maximum longevity” (yrs)“). Do any of these animals surprise you?\n\nWhat does .sort_values(..., ascending=False) do in our code?\n\nSorts the data from smallest to biggest\nSorts the data from biggest to smallest\nRemoves the tallest animals\nReverses the column order\n\n\n\nWhat does .head(8) do?\n\nFinds animals with 8 heads\nRemoves the top 8 rows of data\nShows the top 8 rows of data\nSorts by animal name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\nCan you modify the above code so that ‘oldest_animals’ has the 12 most long-lived animals instead?\nCan you make another variable called ‘shortest_lived_animals’ that has the 12 most short-lived animals?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the 10th longest lived animal? \n\n\nWhich animal only lives for a maximum of 0.27 years? \n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now going to create a simple horizontal bar plot of the 12 most long-lived animals. In the code below:\n\nThe first line sets the size of the figure.\nThe second line creates a horizontal bar plot (this is a normal bar plot rotated 90 degrees).\nThe third line tells Python to display the plot.\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"]) \nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might we want to rotate the bars to be horizontal (barh) instead of vertical?\n\nSo far this is quite a simple plot, and it doesn’t have any labels or units for the x- and y- axes - this would be considered a poor graph in reality!\nWith matplotlib (our Python plotting package) we can keep adding layers of new information to our plot. We are now going to fill in the x- and y- axis. However, we have left the y-axis blank for you to fill in with a suitable name, for example ‘Animal’ or ‘Species’.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"]) \nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\") \nplt.ylabel(\"______\") # ← Label for y-axis\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nCan you remember what plt.show() does?\n\nSave the plot\nAdd labels\nDisplay the plot\nStyle the graph\n\n::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have now created a simple plot of animal longevity!\n\n\n\nOur graph above looks quite good but we might want to customise it more to our liking. We could first change the colours. We do this by passing an additional ‘argument’ to our command plt to let it know the colours we want to use. An example of changing all the colours of our graph is below. (Note: the spelling of ‘colour’ is American in python).\nWe have also added a title to our graph to explain what we are seeing.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"], \n         color=[\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"purple\", \"pink\", \"brown\", \"gray\", \"cyan\", \"teal\", \"magenta\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"Top 12 Longest-Living Animals in the Data\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use any colours you like to customise the graph. You just have to change the name of the colours inside the ‘color’ argument. The ones below all come included with matplotlib.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as the colours that come included, matplotlib lets you to pick any colour using a hexcode (a 6 character number/letter code after a hash/#).\nWe can create hexcodes for colours using some of these links:\n\nhttps://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/\nhttps://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel\nhttps://www.colorhexa.com/6738c9\nhttps://imagecolorpicker.com/en\n\nThe last link will allow you to create a colour palette from an image and give you the hex codes for the palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\nCan you change the colours of the graph using the inbuilt colour names in matplotlib?\nCan you change the colours using hexcodes instead? Maybe you could pick colours that remind you of the animals? If you’re unsure what they look like then use Google to check. Otherwise, just select colours you like. ☺\n\n\n\nAnother way we can modify our graph is by using a different ‘theme’. Themes are different ways of styling the plot, for example background colour, default bar colours, fonts, gridlines, etc. Matplotlib comes with prepared styles that you can use to modify your graph.\nWe can then see a list of which styles we can use using this code:\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.available\n\n\n['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery', '_mpl-gallery-nogrid', 'bmh', 'classic', 'dark_background', 'fast', 'fivethirtyeight', 'ggplot', 'grayscale', 'petroff10', 'seaborn-v0_8', 'seaborn-v0_8-bright', 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark-palette', 'seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid', 'seaborn-v0_8-deep', 'seaborn-v0_8-muted', 'seaborn-v0_8-notebook', 'seaborn-v0_8-paper', 'seaborn-v0_8-pastel', 'seaborn-v0_8-poster', 'seaborn-v0_8-talk', 'seaborn-v0_8-ticks', 'seaborn-v0_8-white', 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', 'tableau-colorblind10']\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is a style you can use in matplotlib?\n\nggplot\nsnapchat\nseaborn\nfancystyle\n\n\nAn example of one of the styles applied to our graph is below:\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"Top 12 Longest-Living Animals in the Data\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\nPick a style! Apply it to your graph instead of the one used in the example above. Try a few, which do you like best?\nCan you include a theme AND your custom colours?\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use a theme and prefer the default appearance, you can change it back at any time by running this block of code.\n\n\nCode\n\nplt.style.use('default')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal challenge\n\n\n\n\nNow, using everything we’ve learned, can you modify the code to create a plot of the shortest-lived animals in the dataset - remember that earlier in the activity we created a variable storing the data called shortest_lived_animals.\n\nDon’t worry if this part proves tricky and ask the teachers for help at any point if you get stuck!\n\n\nWell done! You have now learned how to create a plot of using Python!",

    "text": "Graphs are extremely important for communicating data quickly and effectively. You might have created a graph in MicroSoft Excel before. When you do, you have to click around the software to modify the graph’s appearance and what data it uses. This might not take too much time if you’re only doing it once but what if you had to make similar graphs another ten times? A hundred times? Or a thousand times? The process would quickly get very boring, take a lot of time, and you’d be more likely to make mistakes!\nWe can use Python to write programs that plot our data. The program acts as instructions to create the graph. It’s very customisable and you can use the same code over and over again! Many of the graphs and visualisations you see in magazines, newspapers and social media are created using programming. Data scientists and statisticians create graphs to communicate data to doctors, politicians, CEOs, etc., to influence important decisions.\nIn this activity you are going to create your own graphs using Python.\nDon’t feel nervous if this is your first time using Python and you don’t understand all the code (this is a normal feeling for programmers too). You won’t be asked to write your own from scratch, only to edit what we give you."

Themes are different ways of styling the plot, for example background colour, default bar colours, fonts, gridlines, etc. Matplotlib comes with prepared styles that you can use to modify your graph.\nWe can then see a list of which styles we can use using this code:\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.available\n\n\n['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery', '_mpl-gallery-nogrid', 'bmh', 'classic', 'dark_background', 'fast', 'fivethirtyeight', 'ggplot', 'grayscale', 'petroff10', 'seaborn-v0_8', 'seaborn-v0_8-bright', 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark-palette', 'seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid', 'seaborn-v0_8-deep', 'seaborn-v0_8-muted', 'seaborn-v0_8-notebook', 'seaborn-v0_8-paper', 'seaborn-v0_8-pastel', 'seaborn-v0_8-poster', 'seaborn-v0_8-talk', 'seaborn-v0_8-ticks', 'seaborn-v0_8-white', 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', 'tableau-colorblind10']\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is a style you can use in matplotlib?\n\nggplot\nsnapchat\nseaborn\nfancystyle\n\n\nAn example of one of the styles applied to our graph is below:\n\n\nCode\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"Top 12 Longest-Living Animals in the Data\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\nPick a style! Apply it to your graph instead of the one used in the example above. Try a few, which do you like best?\nCan you include a theme AND your custom colours?\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use a theme and prefer the default appearance, you can change it back at any time by running this block of code.\n\n\nCode\n\nplt.style.use('default')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal challenge\n\n\n\n\nNow, using everything we’ve learned, can you modify the code to create a plot of the shortest-lived animals in the dataset - remember that earlier in the activity we created a variable storing the data called shortest_lived_animals.\n\nDon’t worry if this part proves tricky and ask the teachers for help at any point if you get stuck!\n\n\nWell done! You have now learned how to create a plot of using Python!",

    "text": "Advanced/additional activities\nThis section is entirely optional and you should only attempt it if you have completed all the coding changes on the previous page.\nWhen we first looked at our dataset at the start it had columns containing extra information. One column of interest is “type”, which lets us know what type of animal they are (mammal, reptile, etc). Let’s manually inspect what type of animal the longest-lived animals are…\n\n\nCode\nprint(oldest_animals[[\"Type\", \"Common name\", \"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"]])\n\n\n          Type         Common name  Maximum longevity (yrs)\n0     Molluscs   Ocean quahog clam                    507.0\n1         Fish     Greenland shark                    392.0\n2      Mammals       Bowhead whale                    211.0\n3         Fish   Rougheye rockfish                    205.0\n4    Echinoids      Red sea urchin                    200.0\n5     Reptiles  Galapagos tortoise                    177.0\n6         Fish       Lake sturgeon                    152.0\n7      Mammals               Human                    122.5\n8      Mammals          Blue whale                    110.0\n9   Arthropods             Lobster                    100.0\n10     Mammals        Killer whale                     90.0\n11       Birds       Pink cockatoo                     83.0\n\n\nAre there any of these you haven’t heard of before?\nFor example, echinoids are animals that have a spikey hard shell. Echinoids evolved about 450 million years ago, which is about 220 million years before first dinosaurs appeared! Today we would commonly think of them as ‘sea urchins’ but there are plenty of fossils of ancient echinoids. Below is an artist’s rendition of one vs some red and black sea urchins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be useful to colour our graph by the different animal types. This would give our colours more meaning and also allow us to see if there are any patterns in the data. First, we will store all the unique types of animals in a new variable called ‘types’. We can print ‘types’ to see what this includes.\n\n\nCode\ntypes = oldest_animals['Type']\n\nprint(types)\n\n\n0       Molluscs\n1           Fish\n2        Mammals\n3           Fish\n4      Echinoids\n5       Reptiles\n6           Fish\n7        Mammals\n8        Mammals\n9     Arthropods\n10       Mammals\n11         Birds\nName: Type, dtype: object\n\n\nNow we are going to create a colour map for the different types of animals.\nThis code is a little more complex so don’t try to understand all of it. To summarise, we first manually create a colour map for our different types of animals. Then we create a ‘list’, which is a type of information Python can work with to set the colours.\n\n\nCode\n\n# Pick a color for each type of animal\ncolor_map = {\n    'Molluscs': 'purple',\n    'Fish': 'blue',\n    'Mammals': 'orange',\n    'Echinoids': 'teal',\n    'Reptiles': 'green',\n    'Arthropods': 'pink',\n    'Birds': 'red'\n}\n\n# Create a list of colors based on each animal's type\nbar_colors = [color_map.get(t, 'gray') for t in types]\n\n\nWe can then use our colour map in our plotting code. This includes an aditional step where we manually add a legend too so we can see which colour corresponds to which type of animal. (Note, we have given a graph an alternative/more interesting title this time.)\n\n\nCode\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"], color=bar_colors)\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"How Long Do These Animals Live?\")\n\n# Add a legend manually\nlegend_labels = {v: k for k, v in color_map.items()}\nfor color in legend_labels:\n    plt.bar(0, 0, color=color, label=legend_labels[color])  # invisible bars for legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\nFrom this, we can see that many of the most long-lived animals in our dataset are mammals, in particular whales and humans! The longest-lived animal is a mollusc, but there is only one of them.\nThe full code to generate the graph is below:\n\n\nCode\ntypes = oldest_animals['Type']\n\n# Pick a color for each type of animal\ncolor_map = {\n    'Molluscs': 'purple',\n    'Fish': 'blue',\n    'Mammals': 'orange',\n    'Echinoids': 'teal',\n    'Reptiles': 'green',\n    'Arthropods': 'pink',\n    'Birds': 'red'\n}\n\n# Create a list of colors based on each animal's type\nbar_colors = [color_map.get(t, 'gray') for t in types]\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.barh(oldest_animals[\"Common name\"], oldest_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"], color=bar_colors)\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"How Long Do These Animals Live?\")\n\n# Add a legend manually\nlegend_labels = {v: k for k, v in color_map.items()}\nfor color in legend_labels:\n    plt.bar(0, 0, color=color, label=legend_labels[color])  # invisible bars for legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\nUsing the above code, can you modify the colour map and assign your own colours to the types of animals?\nCan you repeat the same steps as above to colour code the data for the shortest-lived animals? To help you we have provided some sample code below that you can modify.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Challenge 9 - check what types of animals there are\ntypes = shortest_lived_animals['Type']\n\nprint(types)\n# 5 unique types of animal: Arthropods, Birds, Fish, Amphibians, Mammals\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Challenge 9 - create the colour map and graph\n\ncolor_map = {\n    '_____': '_____', # ← Enter types and colours in these blank spaces\n    '_____': '_____',\n    '_____': '_____',\n    '_____': '_____',\n    '_____': '_____'\n}\n\n# Create a list of colors based on each animal's type\nbar_colors = [color_map.get(t, 'gray') for t in types]\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.barh(shortest_lived_animals[\"Common name\"], shortest_lived_animals[\"Maximum longevity (yrs)\"], color=bar_colors)\nplt.xlabel(\"Maximum Lifespan (years)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Animal\")\nplt.title(\"How Long Do These Animals Live?\")\n\n# Add a legend manually\nlegend_labels = {v: k for k, v in color_map.items()}\nfor color in legend_labels:\n    plt.bar(0, 0, color=color, label=legend_labels[color])  # invisible bars for legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\nIf you got this far then well done, that concludes all of our activities!
