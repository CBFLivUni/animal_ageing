# Introduction

## Before beginning

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Attention!

Please open [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CBFLivUni/scholars_event/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Findex.ipynb) **in a new tab** and let it load, this may take a few minutes.

This is a short interactive programming activity where you'll learn how to create plots using Python, in a real-life programming environment known as a **Jupyter notebook**. The session should run 60-90 minutes total.

## General guidance and tips

-   Take your time and read all the instructions on this page and the following pages - if you skip forward you may miss *important information that can help you later*
-   You'll be copying and pasting bits of code into the notebook to see what they do:
    -   To **copy**: highlight the code and press 'ctrl' + 'C' on your keyboard
    -   To **paste:** use 'ctrl' + 'V'

## Running the code

Here's an example code block you can try. You can copy the code either by highlighting it and copying OR if you hover over the block a little clipboard symbol will appear to the right. If you click it it will copy the code. Try and copy the example block below.

```{python}

print("I am a Python code block.")

```

Once you've pasted it into a **code cell** in the notebook, run it by clicking the **play button** (see below), or by pressing 'Shift' and 'Enter' on your keyboard.
