    "Graphs are extremely important for communicating data quickly and effectively. You might have created a graph in MicroSoft Excel before. When you do, you have to click around the software to modify the graph's appearance and what data it uses. This might not take too much time if you're only doing it once but what if you had to make similar graphs another ten times? A hundred times? Or a thousand times? The process would quickly get very boring, take a lot of time, and you'd be more likely to make mistakes!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python to write programs that plot our data. The program acts as instructions to create the graph. It's very customisable and you can use the same code over and over again! Many of the graphs and visualisations you see in magazines, newspapers and social media are created using programming. Data scientists and statisticians create graphs to communicate data to doctors, politicians, CEOs, etc., to influence important decisions. \n",

In this activity we're going to need to load two known as `pandas` and `matplotlib`. `Pandas` is a package that lets python read and edit data, much like you'd use Excel to process raw data. `Matplotlib` is the package that then lets us plot the data.
